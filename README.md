Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

The client for this application was "The Gaming Room" and what they wanted us to accomplish was a web-based game called"Draw It or Lose It." This game would be a web-based counterpart to their already successful game. This game had to be, of course, functional in a web-based environment. The game must allow for multiple teams with multiple players on each team. There could not be any duplicate names for players, which is accomplished through the use of the singleton pattern.

I believe I was able to effectively understand and depict the client's requirements and needs, and in turn, take them into consideration to choose the appropriate Operating System to launch the game. I recommended that the client launch with Windows OS, because of its minimal expertise requirements, matched with the overwhelming software support for Windows OS.

I think that firstly writing down and interpreting all of the requirements and needs of the client makes it easier to envision a proper solution for the clients problem. Summarizing the desires, requirements, and design constraints really made it easy to envision the end product. 

The main section of the design document that I would revise is the Requirements and Design Constraints, specifically the Requirements. I wish I would have gone into better detail as well as reference some possible solutions or leave tips/notes. I feel as though after completing a full design document next time I will thoroughly go through each requirement for the product.

I interpreted the needs of the client in many ways, depending on the need. One need is understanding that this web-based game must share visual qualities with its original counterpart. This need was simple to meet and I kept this in mind throughout the design process. On the other hand, another need is choosing an OS for this application to run through. This was not as straightforward. For this need, I thoroughly evaluated the client's other requirements in order to choose the best OS for their application.

I approached the design proccess more open than I did a year ago. I used to be more straightforward when designing application i.e. see the desired requirements, then through trial and error create the application. The Design Document as a whole has helped me understand how I can better evaluate the desires and requirements of a client and make decisions such as what OS to use.
